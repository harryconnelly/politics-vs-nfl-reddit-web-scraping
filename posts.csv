\#||Team|Δ|Record|Comment				
--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--				
1.	| [](/PHI) | Eagles |- | 	1-0	|	Nick Foles went back his primary role as wide receiver as the Eagles escaped the Ryan/Jones connection with a victory.  Mistakes and missteps took center stage and will need to be corrected if the Eagles intend to repeat. 
2.	| [](/NE) | Patriots | -| 	1-0	|	We all know the offense needs help, but the defense looks hugely improved, especially the front 7. Also, watch this gem of a [punt](https://twitter.com/Patriots/status/1038884315914887168) ten more times.  Next week against the Jags will be a struggle for the thin offensive side, but this defense could make a meal of Bortles.
3.	| [](/MIN) | Vikings | -| 	1-0	|	The Vikings' front four played 30 pass rushing snaps and came away with 21 combined pressures.  Danielle Hunter had 8 (leads the NFL), Sheldon Richardson had 7 (leads all DTs), Everson Griffen gave PFF's #1 tackle last year his lowest grade in years, and Linval Joseph had a couple pressures and four run stops (tied for most among DTs).  Call them The Four Norsemen of the Apocalypse.
4.	| [](/LA) | Rams | +1| 	1-0	|	The fact that none of the Rams' starters played in the preseason was evident as they took the first half to shake off rust on both sides of the ball. They got into their groove in the second half by outscoring Oakland 23-0, topped off with [this beauty](https://i.imgur.com/TQNWTaL.jpg).
5.	| [](/JAX) | Jaguars |+2 | 	1-0	|	The Jaguars demonstrated that they have a long way to go to get to where they want to be. Even with the stumbles, they still managed to come out of Week 1 with a victory. Now it's time to see how badly they want revenge against Tom Brady &amp; Company.
6.	| [](/GB) | Packers | +3| 	1-0	|	Mack and friends absolutely embarrassed the Packers in the first half, but the second half belonged to [Rodgers](https://media.giphy.com/media/gvrRYodW8yHIY/giphy.gif), who came out on one leg and casually overcame a 20 point deficit (of course). Next week is the Vikings who will certainly *not* be defeated with only one half of good football.
7.	| [](/KC) | Chiefs | **+5**| 	1-0	|	It was a coming out party for Patrick Mahomes as the Texas Tech grad played in his first season opener as a bonafide starting QB. Mahomes' line of 15/27 for 254 yards and 4 TDs was great, and a majority of that was due to freak Tyreek Hill. Hill's 3 TDs blew open the game. There are concerns about the porous defense, but hopefully the Chiefs can handle the Steelers next week.
8.	| [](/PIT) | Steelers |-2 | 	0-0-1	|	In epic /r/justfuckmyshitup fashion, it seems like [James Conner's hair](https://imgur.com/K1bzvyA) had a tie between ""tight"" and ""whatever was going on back there,"" perhaps a harbinger of the tie that was to come. The penalties came fast and furious, but it doesn't mean they weren't well-deserved. The game was consistently officiated, so the Steelers need to learn to adapt to the new rules or a tie will be a lucky outcome for them.
9.	| [](/ATL) | Falcons | -1| 	0-1	|	Atlanta's single biggest point of off-season emphasis was ""red zone"". Thursday debuted months of preparation and dedication, apparently all to fall flat in favor of the Matt Ryan motto ""Give the ball to ~~the Italians~~ Julio."" For the most talented roster Mr. Ryan has ever been a part of, it was nothing short of depressing. Maybe 2019 will bring a real OC to Flowery Branch, one who focuses on plays inside the red zone - not just trying to get there.
10.	| [](/CAR) | Panthers |+1 | 	1-0	|	The Norv Turner-era started with less of a bang than some Panthers fans would have hoped, but considering the state of the offensive line and the caliber of the Dallas defense, a grinding win is a win nonetheless. The retooled secondary played above expectations and helped the formidable Carolina front seven carry the team to victory. However, injuries have clouded the preparation for the Falcons, in which a win could give the Panthers an early chance to entrench themselves into the division lead.
11.	| [](/NO) | Saints | **-7**| 	0-1	|	Name a more iconic pair than the Chargers and missing game-winnings field goals? Easy. The Saints defense and not living up to expectations.
12.	| [](/BAL) | Ravens |+4 | 	1-0	|	[When a team gets into the playoffs ahead of you, all impartial fans gleefully celebrate, and then you get to play them Week 1.](https://i.redd.it/5ccr4r8fpnf11.gif) 
13.	| [](/LAC) | Chargers | -3| 	0-1	|	Don't let the score fool you. This game was yet another example of the past few years of Chargers football. Zero ability to make appropriate gameplans and gametime adjustments until its too late, zero capability to play special teams, and far too many mistakes offensively (lookin' at you, Travis and Tyrell). The worst part is that this game was very winnable, and the Chargers still played like barf for three quarters. This narrative needs to change.
14.	| [](/WAS) | Redskins |**+7** | 	1-0	|	It's absolutely surreal to see Adrian Peterson not only in a Redskins uniform but leading the team in both rushing and receiving in Week 1 when he wasn't even part of the organization a month ago. With Alex Smith at the helm, both [Jordan Reed](https://i.imgur.com/CdRrTjw.gif) and Chris Thompson healthy, and a seemingly improved defense the Redskins looked dominant, and Jay Gruden nabbed his first opening day victory as head coach and the team's first since 2012. 
15.	| [](/DEN) | Broncos |**+8** | 	1-0	|	Much has been said about Von Miller (he's great), the improvements on offense (cut down the turnovers and this is a playoff-caliber unit), and the impressive rookie class. What hasn't seen a lot of discussion were the gains on ST. Marquette King, the Raiders second-most head scratching move, was as advertised. Brandon McManus shook off his yips to hit two no-doubters from 50, and the punt/kick coverage was stellar. [Tom McMahon](https://www.denverbroncos.com/team/coaches-roster/tom-mcmahon-1), thank you! [Victory Waffles for everyone!](https://i.imgur.com/ksmckbG.jpg)
16.	| [](/TB) | Buccaneers |**+12** | 	1-0	|	The Bucs' offense looked as good as it could possibly be on Sunday, blocking in order to set up a great passing game. The defense, however, could be without its top two cornerbacks against Philly this week.
17.	| [](/HOU) | Texans | -3| 	0-1	|	It had all the hallmarks of a classic loss to the Patriots. A stout effort by the defense, an anemic offense with lots of QB mistakes, oddly-conservative play-calling, talk about a ""moral victory"". But then after about 3 quarters the Texans looked like they woke up and played like the team Texans fans expected them to be. When it comes to the Texans Kool-aid right now I think most fans don't want it, but in a couple of weeks they'll be all on it.
18.	| [](/CHI) | Bears | +1| 	0-1	|	Sunday night showcased both the reasons for optimism about this years’ Bears and the growing pains they’re likely to experience through all season. A 17-0 lead backed by suffocating defense and creative offense seemed to vanish in an instant in the fourth quarter. If this young team can learn from Sunday’s collapse, the Bears will surprise a lot of their opponents this season. 
19.	| [](/SF) | 49ers |-2 | 	0-1	|	Oh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright;/the band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light,/and somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout;/but there is no joy in Santa Clara— Jimmy G has lost a start.
20.	| [](/CIN) | Bengals |+2 | 	1-0	|	The Bengals won in Indianapolis for the first time since 1997. Joe Mixon and John Ross both found the end zone and Dalton calmed down after an early interception, although his best play was probably his touchdown saving tackle.  It was far from a perfect game for the Bengals. The right side of the line gave up two sacks to Margus Hunt so they clearly need to improve their pass protection. But still, a road win to start the season is a very nice upgrade to the beginning of last season when the Bengals lost weeks 1 and 2 at home without scoring a single touchdown. 
21.	| [](/SEA) | Seahawks | -1| 	0-1	|	Obviously, the team's most important offseason issue was addressed as their new punter is incredible, but now that the critical part of the equation is handled, maybe they can turn to the other small areas of concern like the entire rest of the offense. Chris Carson's tryout for the hurdling team was stellar, but for some reason, the coaching staff avoided giving him the ball more. There are certainly still some things to iron out.
22.	| [](/NYJ) | Jets | **+9**| 	1-0	|	Wow. The other shoe finally dropped for Derron Lee, Jamal Adams got the monkey off his back with his first career interception, and Darnold was at the helm of the most exciting looking Jets offense in a decade. Oh and there was also a 31-point quarter. Waking up and finding out this was a dream is going to suuuuuck.
23.	| [](/DAL) | Cowboys | **-5**| 	0-1	|	Dink. Dunk. Dak. For seven of his past nine games, Prescott has thrown for less than 200 yards. Perhaps it’s due to a struggling running game- but it’s difficult to ask for a dominant ground game when defenses can stack every player between the sticks without a downfield threat. With such a dismal offensive performance, fans are finding it difficult to enjoy what may be the best defensive squad in years.
24.	| [](/TEN) | Titans | **-11**| 	0-1	|	The Titans won the time of possession by 3 hours and 58 minutes in a battle with the Dolphins that lasted over 7 hours.  Injuries to Mariota, Lewan and Walker combined with an offense still trying to gel resulted in a 7 point loss.  The Titans were dealt a big blow with the loss of Walker for the year, this loss will linger throughout the whole 2018-2019 season.
25.	| [](/MIA) | Dolphins |+4 | 	1-0	|	Week 1 never answers all of your questions, but the Dolphins are sitting happy after the majority of their gambles looked to pay off this week.  Or maybe they're just still waiting for the lightning to pass by so they can actually get something done.  With national expectations low, and internal ones high, this team is in an odd situation, but so far it looks like the internal ones might have the upper hand.
26.	| [](/OAK) | Raiders | -1| 	0-1	|	A Raiders team striving to overcome negative headlines - and a tough matchup in primetime - came up short in a game that was closer than the score indicates. There was a lot to like on both sides of the ball in the first half. I hope they schedule the second half to be played sometime soon.
27.	| [](/DET) | Lions | **-12**| 	0-1	|	When people say, ""there's no where to go but up"", they are often wrong. No matter how bad things are they can almost always get worse. Still, it's not hard to see how the Lions week 1 performance contained many flukes, and that the ship will get righted in time.
28.	| [](/NYG) | Giants | -4| 	0-1	|	Despite losing by only 5 in a defensive slugfest with one of the better teams in the NFL, the Giants found a way to come out of Sunday's game looking disappointing. Odell is back, but so is Ereck Flowers. Big Blue now travels to Dallas to decide who the bottom-feeder of the NFC East will be.
29.	| [](/IND) | Colts | -2| 	0-1	|	Though the Colts are obviously still rebuilding, Sunday's opener against the Bengals provided an indication that the team is moving in the right direction. More than anything, it was simple mistakes like TY's drop, Vinateri's miss, and Doyle's fumble that cost the Colts a win.
30.	| [](/CLE) | Browns | +2| 	0-0-1	|	What better way to end a seventeen game losing streak than with a tie?
31.	| [](/ARI) | Cardinals | **-5**| 	0-1	|	The Steve Wilks era got off to a disastrous start. There hasn't been a worse home opener (by scoring margin) since the Cardinals played at Sun Devil Stadium in 2003. It's just one game, but the team appeared to regress on both sides of the ball. Being 10 point underdogs against the Rams next week seems fair at this point.
32.	| [](/BUF) | Bills | -2| 	0-1	|	With week 1 finally here, the Bills ended their preseason on a rough note against the Ravens. While the lopsided outing has some fans concerned, it's important to remember that the product put out on the field during an exhibition match is unlikely to resemble what we will see during the team's first real NFL action on Sunday. While it remains unclear if Josh Allen or Nathan Peterman will start, Bills fans anxiously await the start of the season with all eyes on a potential playoff return, as well as a desire to get the gross taste of the late preseason meltdown out of everyone's mouth.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Week 1 of the Official &lt;a href=""/r/NFL""&gt;/r/NFL&lt;/a&gt; Power Rankings.

&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Atlanta&amp;#39;s single biggest point of off-season emphasis was &amp;quot;red zone&amp;quot;. Thursday debuted months of preparation and dedication, apparently all to fall flat in favor of the Matt Ryan motto &amp;quot;Give the ball to &lt;del&gt;the Italians&lt;/del&gt; Julio.&amp;quot; For the most talented roster Mr. Ryan has ever been a part of, it was nothing short of depressing. Maybe 2019 will bring a real OC to Flowery Branch, one who focuses on plays inside the red zone - not just trying to get there.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;10.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/CAR""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Panthers&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;+1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;1-0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;The Norv Turner-era started with less of a bang than some Panthers fans would have hoped, but considering the state of the offensive line and the caliber of the Dallas defense, a grinding win is a win nonetheless. The retooled secondary played above expectations and helped the formidable Carolina front seven carry the team to victory. However, injuries have clouded the preparation for the Falcons, in which a win could give the Panthers an early chance to entrench themselves into the division lead.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;11.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/NO""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Saints&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;0-1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Name a more iconic pair than the Chargers and missing game-winnings field goals? Easy. The Saints defense and not living up to expectations.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;12.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/BAL""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Ravens&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;+4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;1-0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.redd.it/5ccr4r8fpnf11.gif""&gt;When a team gets into the playoffs ahead of you, all impartial fans gleefully celebrate, and then you get to play them Week 1.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;13.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/LAC""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Chargers&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;-3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;0-1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Don&amp;#39;t let the score fool you. This game was yet another example of the past few years of Chargers football. Zero ability to make appropriate gameplans and gametime adjustments until its too late, zero capability to play special teams, and far too many mistakes offensively (lookin&amp;#39; at you, Travis and Tyrell). The worst part is that this game was very winnable, and the Chargers still played like barf for three quarters. This narrative needs to change.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;14.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/WAS""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Redskins&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;1-0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;It&amp;#39;s absolutely surreal to see Adrian Peterson not only in a Redskins uniform but leading the team in both rushing and receiving in Week 1 when he wasn&amp;#39;t even part of the organization a month ago. With Alex Smith at the helm, both &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/CdRrTjw.gif""&gt;Jordan Reed&lt;/a&gt; and Chris Thompson healthy, and a seemingly improved defense the Redskins looked dominant, and Jay Gruden nabbed his first opening day victory as head coach and the team&amp;#39;s first since 2012.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;15.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/DEN""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Broncos&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;1-0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Much has been said about Von Miller (he&amp;#39;s great), the improvements on offense (cut down the turnovers and this is a playoff-caliber unit), and the impressive rookie class. What hasn&amp;#39;t seen a lot of discussion were the gains on ST. Marquette King, the Raiders second-most head scratching move, was as advertised. Brandon McManus shook off his yips to hit two no-doubters from 50, and the punt/kick coverage was stellar. &lt;a href=""https://www.denverbroncos.com/team/coaches-roster/tom-mcmahon-1""&gt;Tom McMahon&lt;/a&gt;, thank you! &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/ksmckbG.jpg""&gt;Victory Waffles for everyone!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;16.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/TB""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Buccaneers&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;1-0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;The Bucs&amp;#39; offense looked as good as it could possibly be on Sunday, blocking in order to set up a great passing game. The defense, however, could be without its top two cornerbacks against Philly this week.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;17.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/HOU""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Texans&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;-3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;0-1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;It had all the hallmarks of a classic loss to the Patriots. A stout effort by the defense, an anemic offense with lots of QB mistakes, oddly-conservative play-calling, talk about a &amp;quot;moral victory&amp;quot;. But then after about 3 quarters the Texans looked like they woke up and played like the team Texans fans expected them to be. When it comes to the Texans Kool-aid right now I think most fans don&amp;#39;t want it, but in a couple of weeks they&amp;#39;ll be all on it.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;18.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/CHI""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Bears&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;+1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;0-1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Sunday night showcased both the reasons for optimism about this years’ Bears and the growing pains they’re likely to experience through all season. A 17-0 lead backed by suffocating defense and creative offense seemed to vanish in an instant in the fourth quarter. If this young team can learn from Sunday’s collapse, the Bears will surprise a lot of their opponents this season.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;19.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/SF""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;49ers&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;-2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;0-1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Oh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright;/the band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light,/and somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout;/but there is no joy in Santa Clara— Jimmy G has lost a start.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;20.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/CIN""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Bengals&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;+2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;1-0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;The Bengals won in Indianapolis for the first time since 1997. Joe Mixon and John Ross both found the end zone and Dalton calmed down after an early interception, although his best play was probably his touchdown saving tackle.  It was far from a perfect game for the Bengals. The right side of the line gave up two sacks to Margus Hunt so they clearly need to improve their pass protection. But still, a road win to start the season is a very nice upgrade to the beginning of last season when the Bengals lost weeks 1 and 2 at home without scoring a single touchdown.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;21.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/SEA""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Seahawks&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;-1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;0-1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Obviously, the team&amp;#39;s most important offseason issue was addressed as their new punter is incredible, but now that the critical part of the equation is handled, maybe they can turn to the other small areas of concern like the entire rest of the offense. Chris Carson&amp;#39;s tryout for the hurdling team was stellar, but for some reason, the coaching staff avoided giving him the ball more. There are certainly still some things to iron out.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;22.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/NYJ""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Jets&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;1-0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Wow. The other shoe finally dropped for Derron Lee, Jamal Adams got the monkey off his back with his first career interception, and Darnold was at the helm of the most exciting looking Jets offense in a decade. Oh and there was also a 31-point quarter. Waking up and finding out this was a dream is going to suuuuuck.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;23.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/DAL""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Cowboys&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;0-1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Dink. Dunk. Dak. For seven of his past nine games, Prescott has thrown for less than 200 yards. Perhaps it’s due to a struggling running game- but it’s difficult to ask for a dominant ground game when defenses can stack every player between the sticks without a downfield threat. With such a dismal offensive performance, fans are finding it difficult to enjoy what may be the best defensive squad in years.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;24.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/TEN""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Titans&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-11&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;0-1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;The Titans won the time of possession by 3 hours and 58 minutes in a battle with the Dolphins that lasted over 7 hours.  Injuries to Mariota, Lewan and Walker combined with an offense still trying to gel resulted in a 7 point loss.  The Titans were dealt a big blow with the loss of Walker for the year, this loss will linger throughout the whole 2018-2019 season.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;25.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/MIA""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Dolphins&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;+4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;1-0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Week 1 never answers all of your questions, but the Dolphins are sitting happy after the majority of their gambles looked to pay off this week.  Or maybe they&amp;#39;re just still waiting for the lightning to pass by so they can actually get something done.  With national expectations low, and internal ones high, this team is in an odd situation, but so far it looks like the internal ones might have the upper hand.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;26.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/OAK""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Raiders&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;-1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;0-1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;A Raiders team striving to overcome negative headlines - and a tough matchup in primetime - came up short in a game that was closer than the score indicates. There was a lot to like on both sides of the ball in the first half. I hope they schedule the second half to be played sometime soon.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;27.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/DET""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Lions&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;0-1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;When people say, &amp;quot;there&amp;#39;s no where to go but up&amp;quot;, they are often wrong. No matter how bad things are they can almost always get worse. Still, it&amp;#39;s not hard to see how the Lions week 1 performance contained many flukes, and that the ship will get righted in time.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;28.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/NYG""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Giants&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;-4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;0-1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Despite losing by only 5 in a defensive slugfest with one of the better teams in the NFL, the Giants found a way to come out of Sunday&amp;#39;s game looking disappointing. Odell is back, but so is Ereck Flowers. Big Blue now travels to Dallas to decide who the bottom-feeder of the NFC East will be.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;29.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/IND""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Colts&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;-2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;0-1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Though the Colts are obviously still rebuilding, Sunday&amp;#39;s opener against the Bengals provided an indication that the team is moving in the right direction. More than anything, it was simple mistakes like TY&amp;#39;s drop, Vinateri&amp;#39;s miss, and Doyle&amp;#39;s fumble that cost the Colts a win.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;30.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/CLE""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Browns&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;+2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;0-0-1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;What better way to end a seventeen game losing streak than with a tie?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;31.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/ARI""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Cardinals&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;0-1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;The Steve Wilks era got off to a disastrous start. There hasn&amp;#39;t been a worse home opener (by scoring margin) since the Cardinals played at Sun Devil Stadium in 2003. It&amp;#39;s just one game, but the team appeared to regress on both sides of the ball. Being 10 point underdogs against the Rams next week seems fair at this point.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;32.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;&lt;a href=""/BUF""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Bills&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;-2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""center""&gt;0-1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;With week 1 finally here, the Bills ended their preseason on a rough note against the Ravens. While the lopsided outing has some fans concerned, it&amp;#39;s important to remember that the product put out on the field during an exhibition match is unlikely to resemble what we will see during the team&amp;#39;s first real NFL action on Sunday. While it remains unclear if Josh Allen or Nathan Peterman will start, Bills fans anxiously await the start of the season with all eyes on a potential playoff return, as well as a desire to get the gross taste of the late preseason meltdown out of everyone&amp;#39;s mouth.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Not much about the deal is known beyond the proposed $20 million over 10 years. It's stated it is a marketing deal to keep him with the Packers brand but off the field come Sunday, and for some time was contemplating the deal.

&gt; Favre, 38, said in a text message to ESPN reporter Ed Werder on Thursday night that he was considering the marketing deal.
&gt; 
&gt; ""There isn't a perfect solution to this, but [Packers president] Mark Murphy is at least trying,"" Favre told ESPN. ""We know what they want and where I stand. His solution, although awkward and unsettling for most, may be the best in the end.""

But the deal was never closed and Favre, after one season with the New York Jets, would play his last 2 seasons in the purple and gold. In his first season, Favre turned back the clock and put on an elite performance, bringing the Vikings to within one field goal of their first Superbowl appearance since the 1970's. 

Like only he could, on 3rd &amp; 15 he left the pocket and fired the ball over the middle to cornerback Tracy Porter's hands. A year later the team would go a pitiful 6-10, with Favre retiring for the final time.
