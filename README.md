### Goal of this project was to work with scraping code from reddit and use natural language processing to compare the information.

## Method and Means
I looked at reddit nfl and reddit politics to compare them and see if my computer utilizing natural language processing could tell the difference. I chose these two subreddits because I wanted to have a meaningful distinction between the two and because there is some overlap in the topic.

## Steps
Scrape, scrub, run natural language processing, then use various types of classification functions to tell the difference. Ended up utilizing logarithmic as the optimal function with an r-squared of 95%.

## Future
In the future I would perform more work and scrub further. There is an api that enables me to scrape more data than I currently have. It would be exciting and fun to do that and see how it performs. I also plan on expiramenting with titles over time to see if the new reddit titles keep up with the old ones.
